in this test directory a set of test data is placed

Test24hSet contains a 144 movie of the same cells time-range(24h).
this dataset is used for default testing and performance testing, it has rather good quality images, so its
ok for prototype testing if a new functionality "could" work. if the test shouldn't take to long
the dataset "TestSmallSet" could be taken, its a small subset of Test24hSet(5 images) for faster testing when there has
to be a lot of testing for observing changes in code this is the better set for less waiting.

TestAdhesions contains images of cut out focal adhesions for directly testing the measuring of those.
This are binary images of different size.

TestFilm is a 144 image movie of a single cell.

TestFixedCells is a dataset with different shaped cells and different sized images to test the "flexibility" of the program.
For testing how it can handle different sizes and shapes. (a good start for testing new area algorithms)

TestFocalAdhesion: this dataset contains stressfiber images + the focal adhesion images for filament verification testing and
integration of the focal adhesion processing.

TestNetwork: this dataset is for testing the ability, how good or bad the filament sensor can handle network images.
Only a small dataset i could be extended.

TestSmallSet: a small subset of Test24hSet for less waiting time during simple but often repeated testing.
